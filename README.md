# V1-Camera Photos SwiftData

![CameraPhotos](Images/CameraPhotos.png)This repository contains the source code for the entire series on picking photos from the photos album or taking a photo with the camera and storing it in a SwiftData entity.

Each video in the series has its own branch so if you have not started from the beginning, make sure that you clone or download the correct branch for the video.

This is the branch for the completed code for the 1st Video in the series. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=T7wf4DGPCHs
